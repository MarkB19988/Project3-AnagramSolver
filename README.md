### I. Description

In this program, the player will be able to enter up to 3 characters and the program will compare these characters to a list of words and give the user the best word it can make using those 3 characters.

### II. User Stories

1. As a player, I would like to be able to enter up to 3 letters
2. As a player, I would want to be given the best word that can be made with those letters
3. As a player, I woud want the program to give me the solution quickly
4. As a player, I would like the program to be stable, and not break if I enter less or more than 3 letters

### III. Genre

This project will be a command line, text based program

### IV. Technical Details

Programming Language/IDE

I will be developing this game using C++ as instructed in the brief. I will be writing the program in Notepad++ and using a website called 'repl.it'. The advantages of using this website is that it can be accessed and used on any device that has an internet connection. That in combination with the fact that using notepad++ keeps the code as plain text so I am able to work on this project wherever I am and on any device.

##### Programming Challenges

During this project, I will need to find a solution to the following problems/challenges.

 - How to get the program to read a file
 - How to compare the words in the file to the characters the user entered

##### Coding Standards

While writing my code, I chose to use indenting rather than spacing, I chose this for two main reasons. Firstly, for me personally, using the tab button is intuative and saves time on not pressing repeatedly or holding the space button. Secondly, tabs are universal for all text editiors, therefor they will appear consistent, regardless of which text editior is used.
