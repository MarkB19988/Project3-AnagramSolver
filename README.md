Coding Standards

While writing my code, I chose to use indenting rather than spacing, I chose this for two main reasons. Firstly, for me personally, using the tab button is intuative and saves time on not pressing repeatedly or holding the space button. Secondly, tabs are universal for all text editiors, therefor they will appear consistent, regardless of which text editior is used.

Another coding standard I wrote with was to place '{' directly underneath previous statements instead of at the begining of a new line, especially within 'if' statements. This was 100% a personal choice as both options will work exactly the same, I simply prefer not to have to jump to the begining of a new line while reading my code.
